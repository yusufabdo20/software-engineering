Summary of "Building Quality Software"
Key Software Engineering Processes
Requirements Gathering

Involves collecting and documenting the software requirements, known as the Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
SRS includes use cases that describe business needs and user flows.
Requirements are categorized into functional, external and UI, system features, and non-functional.
Design

Transforms requirements into a structure that developers can implement using code.
The technical lead defines the system architecture, breaking down requirements into components with defined behaviors, boundaries, and interactions.
Design covers system functions, performance, security, platform characteristics, business rules, application logic, API design, user interfaces, and database design.
Coding for Quality

Focuses on producing maintainable, readable, testable, and secure code.
Coding practices include following coding standards, using automated tools (linters), and commenting in the code.
Quality code should meet software requirements without defects and be clean, consistent, and efficient.
Testing

Verifies that the software meets requirements and is free of bugs.
Testing levels include unit, integration, system, and user acceptance (UAT).
Types of testing are functional, non-functional, and regression.
Proper testing ensures software reliability, security, performance, and efficiency.
Releases

Alpha Release: First functioning version for a select group, may contain errors and incomplete features.
Beta Release: Limited release to external stakeholders for real-condition testing and bug identification.
General Availability (GA) Release: Stable version for all users after addressing beta release feedback.
Documentation

System Documentation: For technical users (engineers, developers, architects), includes README files, comments, architecture/design documents, verification information, and maintenance guides.
User Documentation: For non-technical users, includes user guides, instructional videos, manuals, online help, and inline help.
Learning Outcomes
After watching the video, you will be able to:

List and describe common software engineering processes: requirements gathering, design, coding for quality, testing, releases, and documenting.
Understand the importance of each process in building high-quality software.
Recognize different types of software releases and their purposes.
Appreciate the necessity of thorough documentation for both technical and non-technical users.
