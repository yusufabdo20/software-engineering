Overview of Web and Cloud Development
Basics of Web Interaction
Browsers: Popular ones include Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari.
URL Request: Entering a URL (e.g., www.IBM.com) makes the browser request information from the server.
Server Response: The server sends HTML (structure), CSS (style), and JavaScript (interactivity).
Website Content
Static Elements: Previously stored on the server.
Dynamic Elements: Generated upon request, often involving databases.
Websites typically combine static and dynamic elements for optimal user experience.
Cloud Applications
Similar to websites but built for cloud-based infrastructure, offering scalability and resilience.
Development Environments
Front-End: Client-side, visible and interactive elements using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and related tools.
Back-End: Server-side logic, functionality, and security, often involving databases.
Full-Stack: Knowledge in both front-end and back-end development.
Tools for Developers
Code Editors: Basic tool for writing code.
IDEs (Integrated Development Environments): Provide additional capabilities like integration, building, compiling, and debugging.
Examples: Sublime Text, Atom, Vim, VS Code, Visual Studio, Eclipse, NetBeans.
