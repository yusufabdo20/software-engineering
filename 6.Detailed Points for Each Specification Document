Detailed Points for Each Specification Document
Software Requirement Specification (SRS)
Purpose Statement:

Defines the intended use of the SRS.
Identifies the document’s audience and scope.
Constraints, Assumptions, and Dependencies:

Constraints: Conditions like hardware limitations or standards the software must adhere to.
Assumptions: Presumed conditions necessary for the software to operate, such as specific operating systems.
Dependencies: Other software products or systems that the software relies on.
Requirements Categories:

Functional Requirements: Specific tasks or functions the software must perform.
External Interface Requirements: Interactions between the software and other systems, users, or hardware.
System Features: Core functionalities necessary for the software’s operation.
Non-functional Requirements: Attributes such as performance metrics, security standards, and quality measures.
User Requirement Specification (URS)
User Stories:

Written in a narrative format to capture end-user needs.
Answers three key questions:
Who is the user? Identifies the end-user or role that will use the functionality.
What function needs to be performed? Describes the specific action or task the user needs.
Why does the user want this functionality? Explains the purpose or benefit of the functionality to the user.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT):

Determines if the software meets the user requirements as specified in the URS.
Ensures the end product fulfills user expectations and business needs.
System Requirement Specification (SysRS)
System Capabilities and Interfaces:

Outlines what the entire system is capable of doing.
Describes interactions between different system components and external systems.
User Characteristics:

Details the characteristics of the end-users, including skill levels and other relevant attributes.
Policy and Regulation Requirements:

Specifies any regulatory or policy-related requirements the system must comply with.
Personnel Requirements:

Identifies the staffing and skill requirements necessary for system operation and maintenance.
Performance Requirements:

Sets performance standards and benchmarks the system must achieve.
Security Requirements:

Defines the security measures and protocols necessary to protect the system and its data.
Hardware Requirements:

Specifies the hardware needed to support the system’s software components.
System Acceptance Criteria:

Establishes the criteria for system acceptance, including performance, security, and compliance checks.
Conclusion
After watching the video, you should be able to:

Describe the Steps of the Requirement Gathering Process:

Identify stakeholders, establish goals and objectives, elicit, document, confirm, and prioritize requirements.
Explain the Purpose of a User Requirement Specification (URS) Document:

Captures user stories and expectations.
Serves as a basis for user acceptance testing.
Explain the Purpose of a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) Document:

Details functional, external, system, and non-functional requirements.
Serves as a comprehensive guide for software development and performance benchmarks.
Explain the Purpose of a System Requirement Specification (SysRS) Document:

Outlines system capabilities, interfaces, user characteristics, and various requirements (policy, regulation, personnel, performance, security, and hardware).
Provides a broader scope encompassing the entire system’s requirements.
